### 🛰️ Satellites Radar — Earth & Orbits
Built with Three.js · TypeScript · Vite · Web Workers

An interactive 3D visualization of Earth and Moon with realistic day/night transitions, clouds, atmospheric glow, and real-time tracking of 10,000+ satellites using TLE data.
Built for smooth performance and scalability with Three.js, TypeScript, Vite, and Web Workers.

### 🌟 Features

✅ Physically inspired Earth rendering — day/night, specular reflections, atmospheric glow
☁️ Dynamic clouds layer with transparency and parallax motion
🛰️ Real-time satellite propagation via satellite.js running inside a Web Worker
🎥 Smooth camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan)
🎨 ACES Filmic tone mapping for cinematic visuals
⚙️ Modular architecture — main thread ↔ worker with proper resource cleanup
🖼️ High-resolution NASA textures with graceful fallbacks (8K → 4K → 2K)

### 🧠 Tech Stack

Three.js — 3D engine

satellite.js — TLE propagation

TypeScript — type safety

Vite — fast build & dev server

Web Workers — heavy orbit calculations off-main-thread

(Optional) Git LFS — manage large texture assets

### 🌍 Description

This project visualizes the Earth and the Moon with physically accurate day/night transitions.
The main purpose is to track more than 10,000 satellites orbiting around Earth in real time.

### 🪐 Future Improvements

🌌 UI for satellite filters and search

⏱️ Time controls and orbit animation speed

🧭 Ground track projection

📱 Mobile layout optimization

🧊 KTX2 compressed textures for faster loading
